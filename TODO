 Functionalities:
===========

* Handle chunked requests (Check if it already works)

* Check listen with multiple ports

* server_names

* Make it possible to upload files

* Make it possible to set the cgi extension in the config file instead of just using ".cgi"

* Maybe our root needs to work like alias in nginx according to the subject

 Checks/tests:
===========

* Check almost all throws we do to see if we should handle the error in another way
especially in the HTTP class.

* Check if there really is a need to have the whole program inside a try catch

* Tests with bigger/more complex CGI scrips
