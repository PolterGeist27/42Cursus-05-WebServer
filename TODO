===========
 Functionalities:
===========

* Handle chunked requests (Check if it already works)

* Check listen with multiple ports

* server_names

* Make it possible to upload files

* Only send the response from the CGI when EOF is found, and send EOF to the CGI after the request body is sent

* Maybe its best to create a custom exception to receive the status code to send error responses back to the client

===========
 Checks/tests:
===========

* Check almost all throws we do to see if we should handle the error in another way
especially in the HTTP class.

* Check if there really is a need to have the whole program inside a try catch

* Tests with bigger/more complex CGI scrips
